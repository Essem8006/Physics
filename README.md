For the potential landscape, on the load of the document you can left click to add positive charge or right click to add negative charge, once ready click generate. You can then hold left click and move the mouse in order to move around. The aqua circle is a ball in the middle. There are a few problems if you stack charge on top of the ball but other than that it should be fine. On the top left you can see the stats and in the top right you can set visible to true and then adjust the y value of a plane to identify lines of equipotential.

It was inspired by the following image. (don't expect to get this though!)
